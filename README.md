# Async IP Connections

Multiplatform C library for synchronous and asynchronous [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (v4 or v6) communications, using the same interface for [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) transports.

### Build Dependencies

This library depends on [Simple Multithreading](https://github.com/LabDin/Simple-Multithreading) project, which is added as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).

It also uses the available [IP sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) implementation, which provided by all supported platforms (**Windows** and **Linux**, for now).

### Documentation

Descriptions of how the functions and data structures work are available at the [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html)-generated [documentation pages](https://labdin.github.io/Async-IP-Connections/files.html)
